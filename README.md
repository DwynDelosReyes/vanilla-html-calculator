📄 Project Overview

Vanilla Calculator is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was developed as part of Lasallian Codespace Capstone 1, in collaboration with @carloooseee. It demonstrates the fundamentals of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript programming in a practical, interactive application.

The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations including:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)
- Clearing inputs

It is fully implemented with vanilla JavaScript, meaning no libraries or frameworks were used.
